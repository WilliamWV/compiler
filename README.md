# compiler
Compiler project to UFRGS' compilers course

This project was originally developed at https://gitlab.com/ofzorzo/trabalho-compiladores, in a group project composed by ofzorzo and me and is mostly in Portuguese.
It is a compiler to a programming language similar to C, the compiler was developed using lex and yacc to syntactic and semantical definitions and its core is mostly implemented using C language.
Each stage ('etapaX' folders) can be build by using 'make', the Makefile will produce a runnable file named 'etapaX'.
The final purpose of this compiler is to convert a valid program written on its programming language to ILOC structures.
